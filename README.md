# SharpTransitions

A library for animated UI transitions for .NET.

## Overview

The Transitions library lets you create animated transitions of any properties of user-interface elements for .NET. It provides an easy way to perform UI animations in .NET in a similar way to the Core Animation library for Apple and the iPhone.

## Getting started

You can animate a single property of an object with a single line of code like this:

```
Transition.Run(this, nameof(BackColor), Color.Red, new Methods.Linear(1000));
```

If this code is in a form class, it animates the background color from its initial color to red over the course of 1000ms.

You can animate multiple properties (maybe across multiple objects) simultaneously with code like this:

```csharp
var transition = new Transition(new Methods.EaseInEaseOut(2000));
transition.Add(pictureBox1, nameof(Left), 300);
transition.Add(pictureBox1, nameof(Top), 200);
transition.Run();
```

This animates the movement of pictureBox1 from its initial location to (300, 200) over the course of 2000ms.

## Coding with Transitions

The TestApp project demonstrates a number of different transitions. It is fairly well commented, and can act as a tutorial to help get you started.

For more information on how to code with the Transitions library see the coding reference.
