# FluentTransitions

[![NuGet Status](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/FluentTransitions.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FluentTransitions/)

FluentTransitions lets you create animated transitions of any property of user-interface elements in .NET. It provides a simple API to perform UI animations in a similar way to Apple's Core Animation library for iOS, iPadOS and macOS.

<sup>FluentTransitions powering [FluentDragDrop](https://github.com/awaescher/FluentDragDrop), a library to create stunning drag and drop effects with Windows Forms.</sup>

## What can it do for me?

FluentTransitions allows smooth UI transitions with Windows Forms and GDI+. While the animation above shows several effects in combination, you will probably start with simpler things like the transition of a property of a Windows Forms control:

```csharp
var maxTop = button1.Parent.Height - button1.Height;

Transition
    .With(button1, nameof(Top), maxTop)      // target, property, value
    .Bounce(TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(500)); // method and duration
```

### Multi targeting

Transitions can manipulate multiple properties from one or multiple objects simultaneously just by chaining the `.With()` methods:

```csharp
Transition
    .With(button1, nameof(Left), 300)
    .With(button2, nameof(Top), 200)
    .With(Form1, nameof(Opacity), 0.0)
    .EaseInEaseOut(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(2));
```

This code animates the movement of two buttons while it fades out the whole form. All of this is running in parallel within two seconds.

### Chaining

Some effects might require multiple transitions to be executed sequentially. FluentTransitions provides a concept called "Chaining". To use it, simply build your transitions and run them with `Transition.RunChain(...)`:

```csharp
Transition.RunChain
(
    Transition
        .With(button1, nameof(Left), 300)
        .With(button2, nameof(Top), 200)
        .Build(new Linear(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1))),
    Transition
        .With(Form1, nameof(Opacity), 0.0)
        .Build(new Linear(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1)))
);
```

This code animates the movement of two buttons first. Once this is done, it fades out the whole form. Both transitions are completed within two seconds.

### Completion

Each transition raises an event once it is completed. This can be useful to run code after the UI is done with animating.

```csharp
var t1 = Transition
    .With(button1, nameof(Left), 300)
    .With(button2, nameof(Top), 200)
    .Build(new EaseInEaseOut(500));
    
t1.TransitionCompletedEvent += (sender, args) => this.Close();
    
Transition.Run(t1);
```

> Prefer `Transition.RunChain()` to run animations after a prior animation did complete:

# More Samples

Back in the year 2011, I used these transitions to spice up two login forms for a customer project. Be kind to me, I was young and just wanted to make something fancy. Nevertheless, I think it's pretty special to WinForms.

But FluentTransitinons is more that just smoothly moving and sizing controls, you can do pretty much everything if you're creative enough.
